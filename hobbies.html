    <br>
        <p>I have been drawing since I was 12. I never learned how to trace, so I just drew.</p>

    <br>
        <p>I started building Gundam models around the same age; 12. I started painting and detailing them wen I was 15.
        Since then, I learned to see fine details in everything.</p>

    <br>
        <p>I took my passion for drawing and detailing into cake decorating. I graduated from cake decorating class in 2010. I even made and decorated my sisters' wedding cake.</p>
