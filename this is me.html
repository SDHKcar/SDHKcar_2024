    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Domingo Rainier Almazan Fernandez III, but I go by Rainier. I am a Navy veteran who served from 2005 to 2008 in Yokosuka, Japan. During my service, I mastered the Japanese martial art of Kendo, achieving the rank of GoDan (5th degree black belt) 
            through an accelerated experimental program. Transitioning to civilian life in 2008, I pursued cake decorating and became the sole male graduate of the course in 2009. I furthered my education at ITT Technical Institute, earning an Associates in 2013 and a Bachelors in 2015 in IT. 
            My career path led me to roles at Sycuan Casino as part of the count team, then at a Korean BBQ, where my military background contributed to my promotion to kitchen lead. 
            I had to leave the Korean BBQ job due to Covid-19-related restaurant closures and has since held various short-term positions.</p>
