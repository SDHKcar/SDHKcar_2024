    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Domingo Rainier Almazan Fernandez III, but I go by Rainier. I am a Navy veteran who served from 2005 to 2008 in Yokosuka, Japan. During my service, I mastered the Japanese martial art of Kendo, achieving the rank of GoDan (5th degree black belt) 
            through an accelerated experimental program. Transitioning to civilian life in 2008, I pursued cake decorating and became the sole male graduate of the course in 2009 at National City Adult School. I furthered my education at ITT Technical Institute, earning an Associates in 2013 and a Bachelors in 2015 in IT. 
            My career path led me to roles at Sycuan Casino as part of the count team, then at a Korean BBQ, where my military background contributed to my promotion to kitchen lead. 
            I had to leave the Korean BBQ job due to Covid-19-related restaurant closures and has since held various short-term positions.</p>
        <p>I’m a tech-savvy, rhythm-driven creative with a deep passion for Dance Dance Revolution, which serves as both a long-time hobby and an intense fitness routine. My background blends gaming, Japanese pop culture, and hands-on making—I enjoy 3D printing, Gundam modeling, and designing custom templates inspired by samurai armor.
            I’m also experienced in coding interactive web experiences, always approaching projects with curiosity and attention to detail. Drawing from my Filipino background, I like to bring cultural nuance and playfulness into my work. With a mindset shaped by martial arts discipline, 
            I strive to combine resilience and precision in everything I do.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include: drawing, playing the piano, layout planning, martial arts, 3D printing (FDM and Resin), Building Gundam models, DJ at family parties, streaming my model builds on Youtube and Twitch, and wrapping my car. All of my hobbies revolve around attention to detail, something I really like doing. </p>
